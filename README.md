# Monarch Butterfly Webpage

This is a simple static frontend webpage that I made for a class. I built this webpage using this HTML5 Up!: https://html5up.net/telephasic. I added three webpages independent from the template while maintaining the style/design. There's no framework, this webpage was made purely with HTML, CSS, and JS.
